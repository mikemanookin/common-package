function linearFilter = getLinearFilterOnline(stimulus, response, sampleRate, freqCutoff)
    % This function will find the linear filter that changes row vector "signal" into a set of "responses" in rows. 
    % samplerate and freqCutoff (which should be the highest frequency in the signal) should be in Hz.

    % The linear filter is a cc normalized by the power spectrum of the signal.
