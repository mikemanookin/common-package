function results = spikeDetectorOnline(data, threshold, sampleRate)
    % A fast spike detector function for online analysis. data is a matrix of spike recording data. threshold is the
    % deflection threshold to call an event a spike and not noise. If no threshold is provided, 1/3 maximum deflection
    % amplitude is used as threshold. This does a pretty good job for big-ish spikes and it's fast. Use something more
    % versatile for offline analysis.
